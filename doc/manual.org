* Introduction
Obtaining meta-information (biological annotation etc) for
metabolomics data can be a quite tedious process involving scripting,
cross-referencing and hand curating multiple online databases. Reasons
for this include :

- Identifiers of metabolites used in raw data often is not easily
  convertible to the indentifiers used by online databases.
- Online databases often do not share any single primary keys.
- Databases may list multiple entries for the same metabolite.
- No single identifier type is used by all resources.
- Comparing different resources, there may be errors in the sense that
  same identifier can be used to refer to different metabolites.

These problems makes sharing, managing and analysing metabolomics data
tedious since it is difficult to keep a machine readable list of the
different ways to reference metabolites.

** Metmask
This is where the metmask tool comes into the picture by facilitating
the process of mapping identifier names, including identifiers of
*analytes*, to other known identifiers. The process of grouping many
identifiers to a single entity is here called to *mask* the
identifiers. The group of identifier is correspodingly called a *mask*
Currently metmask can do the following:
*** Features
- Incorporate an arbitrary list with any kind of identifier and keep
  track of which identifier is associated with which by assigning them
  to internal mask identifiers.
  - Keep track of the connection information, i.e. which source was
    used for which connection.
  - Annotate connections as /weak/ or /non-weak/ depending on if they
    are ambiguous or not. 
  - Fusing different masks if input data implies that the masks are the
    same.
- Import widely used databases such as the main NIST library, the KEGG
  and PlantCyc compounds files.
- Query the database and extract one or all related identifiers for any
  known identifier.
- Query PubChem and KEGG for identfiers that are not in the local
  database and save any new associations.
- Output in different formats, including graphs which can easily be
  visualized using e.g. [[http://www.cytoscape.org][cytoscape]] or [[http://www.r-project.org][R]] (with [[http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rgraphviz.html][Rgraphviz]]).
*** What metmask is not
Metmask in its current form does not:

- Provide a way to identify metabolites based on their Mass spectra,
  chromatographical retention indexes or similar. Metmask can however
  associate ambiguous information (such as mass forumlae) and provides a
  way to search for these.
- Ensure that the identifiers mapped to by the database is correct in
  terms of what the original creators of the identifiers
  intended. Metmask only knows what is being imported into the
  database and it holds that if you put garbage in you get garbage
  out. 
*** Why metmask?
A great advantage of metmask compared to other databases [fn:1] such
as more comprehensive databases such as PubChem is that

- it is easy to tailor to only load the desired sources in the
  database so that it matches the desired platform. For e.g. GC-MS
  metabolomics data, this would imply that all stereo-isomers of one
  metabolite should be behind the same mask since stereo-isomers
  usually are not resolved.
- comparing to online queries metmask is very fast
- combining different databases is easy whereas online databases may
  be lacking the source of interest (e.g. one cannot directly query
  for [[http://www.arabidopsis.org][AraCyc]] using PubChem but this is easily done in metmask).
  - connections which requires intermediate identifiers is also
    straight-forward in metmask.

A word of caution, metmask assumes certain basic skills working with a
shell. If you do wish to use metmask but feel that you need a
graphical user environment, then please post a message on the user
forum at http://metmask.sourceforge.net.

* Installation
** Linux 
Download metmask-<x.y.z>.tar.gz and
1. Unpack with 
   : tar -zxvf metmask-<x.y.z>.tar.gz
2. Go to created directory 
   : cd metmask-<x.y.z>
3. install either as root
   : sudo python setup.py install
   or locally
   : python setup.py install --home=<dir>
4. in case you used the --home switch, tell python where you installed
   the package e.g.
   : export PYTHONPATH=<dir>/lib/python
** Windows
Download metmask-<x.y.z>.exe and execute it. Open the windows shell
via the start menu (run command "cmd"). Note that metmask is currently commandline only so you need to type the commands.
* Configuration
When metmask is first executed it creates the file ``~/.metmask.cfg``
which specifies the defaults values for the options listed
above. Options given explicitly over-rides the configuration file.

The package comes with a default database is the one queried
automatically. If you install the package as adminisitrator/root you
will not have write-access to this database and will therefore not be
able to edit the database -- only query it. To get your own database,
just copy the default database (its location will be in the
configuration file after you first run the program or shown when
trying to execute metmask) to wherever you have read/write access and
edit the configuration file accordingly:
#+begin_example
...
[general]
db = <path to your read/write accessible database>
...
#+end_example
Further configuration options are shown below.

* Usage
The program is interfaced using the script called metmask. To invoke
it just execute ``metmask`` from the command-line. The default action
is to read identifiers from standard input, guess what kind of
identifier it is and then query the local database for that
identifier. The following options are available:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  metmask --version 
#+END_SRC 
#+resname:
: This is metmask v0.5.1
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  metmask --help
#+END_SRC 
#+resname:
#+begin_example
Usage: metmask [X] [options]
X represents a stream of identifiers from STDIN 
or a single identifier if -a is set or a file with 
identifiers, one per line. If X is not provided one
or more of the options below must be set.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a IDENTIFIER, -q IDENTIFIER, --query=IDENTIFIER, --as-is-id=IDENTIFIER
                        A single  identifier to query the data base for to be
                        interpreted as is. Also searches for weak (ambiguous)
                        identifiers is the universal argument is set
  -w, --wild            Input query may contain wild cards ('_' matches any
                        single character and '%' matches any sequence of
                        characters).
  -t TABLE, --table=TABLE
                        Identifier is of type TABLE (i.e. identifier type).
                        Metmask tries to guess which table is meant in case
                        unspecified. Multiple tables can be given comma
                        separated.
  -g TABLE, --goal=TABLE
                        Fetch goal identifier of TABLE or use 'ALL' to get all
                        entries. Multiple tables can be given pipe separated.
  -d PATH, --db=PATH    Use database located at PATH
  -s, --stats           Print some statistics of the current database. Print
                        more stats if the universal argument is set.
  -v, --verbose, --debug
                        Be more verbose, print debug information
  -i FILE, --import=FILE
                        Populate database using this file. For importing the
                        KEGG compounds file or the PlantCyc compounds file,
                        FILE can also be one of the keywords 'cyc' or 'kegg'
                        in order to use the ftp provided files. Local files
                        have precedence. Universal argument: Never ask before
                        merging on input, guess what to do
  -n NAME, --name=NAME  Each import is given a name, usually this equals the
                        filename or name of external database but can be set
                        explicitly with this option
  -c CODE, --confidence-code=CODE
                        The confidence code of the data to import
  -p PARSER, --parser=PARSER
                        Use this parser to populate the database

                        text represenation of all info in the mask, graph: a
                        connection graph to use for visualization in e.g.
                        cytoscape.
  -M MASTER, --master=MASTER
                        Master identifier for this import
  -m, --merge-interactively
                        If set, ask about merging masks upon insert.
  -r MMID, --remove=MMID
                        Drop mask with this mmid. Can not be undone!
                        Universal argument: Do not ask about deletions before
  -x TABLES, --export=TABLES
                        Export all information in the provided tables (comma
                        separated, potentially quoted). Use the keyword ALL
                        for exporting all known tables.
  -u, -F, --universal   Universal argument. If set, causes some arguments to
                        act differently.
  -f, --first           Only return one identifier of each queried table.
                        Suppress printing multiple identfiers.
  -e, --external        Try to query PubChem and KEGG if no suitable match
                        could be found. Universal argument: Save retrieved
                        information in the local database
  -1, --one-hit         Only return the first hit  from the database
  -Q, --no-quote        Suppress addition of quotes to output
  -S, --synchronize     Upon import, minimize the creation of new masks,
                        instead just populate the existing ones and ignore all
                        other input
#+end_example

** Examples
*** Import
To import the KEGG compounds file directly from the KEGG FTP server:

: metmask -i kegg

To import a comma delimited file, test.csv, with identifiers
structured as
: myId,synonym,weak:type
: a1,alanine,amino-acid
: a2,ala,amino-acid
: a1,ala,amino-acid
: a3,sucrose,sugar
: a4,lysine,amino-acid
we call
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
metmask --import test.csv --parser simple --master myId --db /tmp/test-db
#+END_SRC
The first line in a test.csv names the types of identifiers. These
will afterwards be possible query using the -t switch e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
metmask --query a1 --table myId --goal synonym --db /tmp/test-db
#+END_SRC

#+resname:
: '"alanine"|"ala"'

The input comma delimited file should be structured as:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
tablename1 , <confidence code>:tablename2 , tablename3
table1-id1 , table2-id1                   , table3-id1|table3-id2|table3-id3
table1-id1 , table2-id1                   , table3-id1|table3-id2|table3-id3
...
#+END_EXAMPLE
and is in the example above read by the parser "simple". Note that the
confidence code can be used to specify whether a table is "weak" or
not. In the example, test.csv, type is used to set a metabolite type
but this type is not used to group metabolites, only to annotate
them. See [[*Query]] for further details.

*** Query
To query the database for everything it knows about alanine::
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  metmask --query alanine --goal ALL --output mask -d /tmp/test-db
#+END_SRC 

#+resname:
#+begin_example
o-o-o-o:
mask:
[1]
myId:
a1 test.csv 3 test.csv 3
a2 test.csv 3
synonym:
alanine test.csv 3
ala test.csv 3 test.csv 3
preferred:
2:ala test.csv 0
#+end_example

or to get all metabolites we specified as type "amino-acid" in a
format that is easy to import to other programs.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  metmask --query amino-acid --table type --goal myId,synonym -d /tmp/test-db
#+END_SRC 

#+resname:
: '"a1"|"a2"','"alanine"|"ala"'
: '"a4"','"lysine"'

Note that the input has been masked so that "a2" also is associated
with "alanine" even though this was never explicitly specified in the
input.

The import also specified a 'master' identifier which is interpreted
as the source for connections. In this case, each line in test.csv is
therefore read as myId /connects/ to synonym. When a master identifier
has been set, we can produce graph like output:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
metmask --query a1 --table myId --goal ALL --output graph --db /tmp/test-db -u
#+END_SRC

#+resname:
: myId:a1	synonym:alanine	test.csv	False
: myId:a1	synonym:ala	test.csv	False
: myId:a1	type:amino-acid	test.csv	True
: myId:a2	synonym:ala	test.csv	False
: myId:a2	type:amino-acid	test.csv	True

which gives the previous list (which can be imported to [[http://www.cytoscape.org][Cytoscape]] for
visualization, simply click import from file and set the first column
as source node and second column as target node.). The columns are
Node 1, Node 2, Source of edge and an indicator for whether the
connection should be considered "weak" or not. The "-u" switch tells
metmask to also output weak identifiers.

#+CAPTION: The connection graph for the example file test.csv as visualized by Cytoscape.
[[./test.png]]

If you have a file of identifiers that you want to query the database
for KEGG identifiers you can simply use standared shell re-direction
and query as:

 : cat myFileWithIdentifiers | metmask -g kegg
** Special usages
A problem one sometimes faces is that used identifiers (e.g. synonyms)
for is that identifiers are difficult to use in graphical
representations such as plots. Manual conversion on a 'plot-per-plot
basis' is of course not desirable and for this purpose one can use the
special metmask table 'preferred'. Each mask is given exactly on
preferred identifier upon import (the first non-empty identifier if it
is not set explicitly). One way to fix the synonyms (assuming they are
already known to the database) would be to export the current
preferred labels:

 : cat mySynonyms | metmask -g preferred > myPreferred

then merge to get a new input:
  
 : paste mySynonyms myPreferred > myInput
 : echo -e "synonym\tpreferred" | cat - myInput

then manually edit ``myInput`` to set the preferred labels as desired
and do:

 : metmask -i myInput -p simple

now you can query those any identifiers associated with the original
synonyms and be sure to always get your desired preferred labels.
* Parsers and file formats
** Import formats
The parsers are modules that can read specific file formats, extract
the important data and commit it to the database. The parsers that are
included in the main distribution are listed in Table
\ref{tab:parsers} and \ref{tab:formats}.

#+CAPTION: Available parsers. Name is the name of the parser module, Tables are the types of identifiers that are extracted and imported from the resource, Weak tables are types of identifiers that are imported as weak tables.

The CSV file is structured so that the first line is header naming the
types of identifiers that are listed below. The header my also specify
if all indentifiers below should be imported as weak eg

: mylocalid,cas,synonym,weak:formula

for a file specifiying links between mylocalid a CAS registry number,
synonyms and sum formula (which should be imported as weak). Following
lines list the identifiers. Multiple identifiers for the same
identifier type are separated by the pipe "|" character. Identifiers
that contain comma must be surrounded by quotes (nested quotes are
allowed) eg:

: id-001,"'50-40-1'|'50-43-2'","1-2,non-existing-compound",C6H6O6

When reading compounds.dat, lines that start with # are considered
comments and ignored.
*** Quality control
The database defines the following regular expressions must be matched for the
corresponding identifier types:

- kegg :: [cCdD]\d{5}$
- cas :: \d{1,7}-\d{2}-\d{1}$
- _id :: \d+$
- rlib :: [a-z|A-Z]{0,1}\d{4}
- kappav :: [kK][pP][cC]\d{5}
- knapsack :: [cC]\d{8}
- tsuruoka :: [tT]-\d+$
- cqid :: cq_\d{5}$
- cid :: \d+$
- sid :: \d+$
- inchi :: InChI=.+
- metlin :: \d+$
- hmdb :: hmdb\d+$

attempting to add identifiers in those of those types that does not
match the corresponding expression will raise an exception.

** Export formats
Output is done in three different formats. 

- flat :: Text file, where each line represents one identfifier group,
          identifier types are by default delimited by comma and
          individual identifiers delimited by the pipe
          character. Double quotes surround each identifier type and
          single quotes surround each identifier.
- graph :: A tab delimited file with four columns and one line per
           edge in the output graph. First colum is the source node,
           second column the target node, third column indicate the
           source of the edge and fourth column indicate if link is
           weak or not.
- mask :: An overview text representation of the entire identifier
          group. One identifier per line and every identifier types is
          preceeded by the name of that identifier type as a header.

* Implementation
This section is not directly necessary to read in order to use the
program.
** Glossary
Before describing the current implementation it is necessary to
clarify some concepts:

- mask :: A group of identifiers that all are associated with the same
	  biological compound.

- table :: A type of identifier such as CAS number or KEGG ID.

- identifier :: A specific identifier such as the KEGG ID C00001.

- analyte :: A compound that is identified by the chromatographic
             method at hand.

- metabolite :: A chemical compound that can be found *in vivo*

- preferred :: A special table that holds excatly one string for each
               mask. This string is meant to provide a human readable
               name for each mask.
- weak :: An "identifier" which can not be used as metabolite identifier.

** Strategy
Metmask uses a local sqlite3 database to which it can import
information from various user provided re-sources. Ideally, the first
import to the database should be a curated list of identifiers listing
masks that definitely map to different metabolites. These are then
used as a seed data-set to which one can add more identifiers by
importing the desired sources.

Every association is annotated with two attributes. Where it came
from, i.e. its source and its confidence code. The source is kept so
that, upon later exports it is easy to see the chain of evidence. The
confidence code is a bit more complicated and is used to determine
which masks is allowed to be merged with which, see [[Merging masks]].
*** Merging masks
As an import proceeds metmask ensures that a single identifier only
maps to a single mask. If one tries to do an import that matches an
already existing mask a conflict arises and the following alternatives
are available to resolve the problem:

- Merge the new information to the exiting mask.
- Annotate the overlapping information as 'weak' and create a new mask.

To minimize errors the following rule-set is used to judge if two
masks should be merged or not.

1. Two masks coming from the same source are compatible
   if they share a non-weak identifier.
2. Two masks coming from different sources are compatible
   if they share at least n types of identifiers, where n is
   user-defined.
3. Two masks are not compatible if they are associated
   with non-equal sum-formulae (ignoring single protons).
4. Two masks are not compatible if both carry an indentifiers
   annotated with 'nevermerge'.
*** Confidence code
The confidence code is an code that which defines whether masks with
those confidence codes are allowed to be merged or not. The code is
either an arbitrary string chosen upon import such as "good" or "bad"
depending on the quality of the source or one of the reserved codes:

- nevermerge :: Two masks that carry identifiers tagged with
  ``nevermerge`` will, as the name suggests never be merged.
- weak :: An indentifier tagged as ``weak`` does not count when
  counting overlap between two masks. All identifier are unique, but
  when adding a mask carrying e.g. the identifier G will not be added
  to the Glycine mask which also carries G if G was tagged as
  ``weak``.

* Additional remarks
** Version numbers
Metmask version numbers are on the form x.y.z. For smaller changes z
is increased. Changes to the database structure and the tables that
are expected to be found in it always include an increase to y. An
increased value of x indicate a stable version which is to be
considered feature complete.
** Caveats
The following is a list of irregular behaviour of metmask.

- Metmask does not allow the pipe character ``|`` in identifiers. Any
  pipes are silently discarded upon import.
  
- Metmask does not perform any comprehensive integrity checks of the
  input, if a incorrect parser is specified, the input might corrupt
  the database.
** Parsers
If you have type of source file which can not easily be converted to
the format above you need to either [[Write your own parser]] or ask for
help to do so. It is fairly easy to do so both strategies will
probably be successful. Please contribute any new parsers to the
metmask project.
*** Write your own parser
The parsers are managed in a plug-in like system. See the source
package metmask/parse for examples, by putting a new parser and naming
it "\_newparser.py" in that directory, it immediately ready to use. See following example for how a parser should be structured.

#+begin_src python
  from metmask.mask import mask
  import metmask.parse 
  from main import fileFormatError
  # function for fixing a string to a vector considering quotations etc
  from main import fixLine
  
  class parser :
      """ < your documentation >
      """
      
      # constructor
      def __init__ (self, parent) :
          # parent is the 'main' class of parser which handles file
          # reading and communication with the metmask database
  
          # make sure to set the table that you use, these are used to
          # create corresponding tables in the database e.g.
          parent.tables = ['cas', 'mylocalid']
          self.parent = parent
  
      # the function that does the actual reading
      def process (self) :
          parent = self.parent
          # get a line of input
          ll = parent.getLine()
          while ll :
              # create a mask object
              un = mask({}, parent.mm.idpatterns) 
              # append the information to the mask (see
              # documentation of the mask object)
              un.append(<table Type>, ll[0], ll[1], ll[2])
              # send the mask to the database
              parent.setMask(un)
              # get a new line
              ll = parent.getLine()
#+end_src

* R-integration
** Via the commandline
Since Metmask is a commandline tool it is easy to use it from R via
the use of R's ``system`` function. An example for checking what CAS
numbers and synonyms are (non-weakly) connected to the KEGG identifier
C00002 could be:

#+BEGIN_src R
system("metmask -a c00002 -g cas,synonym -Q", intern=TRUE)
#+END_src

#+resname:
| "56-65-5" | "42373-41-1" | "987-65-5" | "adenosine 5'-triphosphate" | "adenosine-5'-triphosphate dipotassium salt dihydrate" | "atp" |
obviously, this will only work if metmask in your executable path.
** Via the metmask.db package
One can also use the metmask.db package provide for to interact with the metmask database. Download and install the "special non-official version" of bioconductors AnnotationDbi (version 6.6.6) available via the metmask [[http://metmask.sourceforge.net][project page]]. Also download and install the metmask.db package. In R, the provided database can be queried just as the other AnnotationDbi packages (see vignettes for both AnnotationDbi and metmask.db) e.g to query for the KEGG identifiers associated with alanine:
#+begin_src R :results 
library(metmask.db)
qmetmask("alanine", "kegg")
#+end_src 

#+resname:
| "c00041" |
| "c00133" |
| "c01401" |

* Footnotes

[fn:1] There are databases that try to map metabolites
comprehensively, eg [[http://www.biospider.ca][biospider]] but although they are very useful, they
are much too slow to be used for day-to-day metabolite identifier
mapping

[fn:sdf] For SDF files, identifier type is indicated by e.g. > <CASNO>
following a listing of the associated identifiers. Entries are
separated by four dollar signs.

[fn:cyc] The cycdb parser takes the specified 'source' of the input as
the name of the "UNIQUE ID" table + 'id'. This is done because cyc's
UNIQUE ID are not meant to be used across different cycdb
databases. I.e. if you call the import 'ecocyc' the unique id will be
in 'ecocycid'.
